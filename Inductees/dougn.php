     <h1>Doug Newland</h1>
     <em>1994 inductee       </em>
     <p>A spirited pioneer of disc golf in the northwestern U.S., Doug's unbounded enthusiasm for the sport subdued the doubts of parks officials in his quest for permanent courses. Doug is recognized for helping to forge the idea of a player's organization that the PDGA was to later become. As PDGA #016, Doug volunteered himself from the beginning and worked hard at advancing the sport until his untimely death in 1989. A widely loved figure, Doug's legacy as a disc golf competitor, instructor and promoter will be outshined only by the memory of his passion for enjoying life.</p>
