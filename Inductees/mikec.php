     <h1>Mike Conger</h1>
     <em>1996 inductee       </em>
     <p>Good-natured, hardworking and gifted with a world-class form that early on earned him the nickname of "Captain Snap", Mike Conger is recognized as a pioneer of disc golf at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Inspired by a passion for competitive play, Mike organized some of the largest tournaments ever on the East Coast, and unlike many of the sport's founding fathers remains an active influence on our continued growth.</p>

<p>Mike's grass roots work as a promoter during the sport's formative years was ultimately responsible for the development of dozens of competitions and courses, helping spread the love of disc golf to thousands, and a love of "Captain Snap" to those who've met him.</p>
