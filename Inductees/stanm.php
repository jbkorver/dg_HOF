     <h1>Stan McDaniel</h1>
     <em>2004 inductee       </em>
     <p>Stan's drive to the top of the disc golf world began when his young family moved to Charlotte in the late 1980's. With little ones in strollers on hilly Latta Park course, he began his push to the top. He reached his goal in 1994 by winning the PDGA World Champion Masters title. Stan persevered to repeat this feat in 1996 and 1997. Stan's dedication to course design and construction has produced many disc golf venues including world class courses at Hornets Nest and Renaissance parks. This fun-loving Christian family man has also been recognized by his peers, receiving The Bob West Memorial Sportsmanship Award.</p>
