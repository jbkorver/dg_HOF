     <h1>Dr. Rick Voakes</h1>
     <em>1995 inductee</em><br/>
     <p>A successful Bowling Green pediatrician, Dr. Rick Voakes somehow finds time to excel both as competitor and executive in the world of disc golf. His long-time service to the PDGA has required untold hours of sacrifice and toil on both himself and his constant partner and wife, Sylvia. More than once, Rick's crucial input as a PDGA Board member helped to avert the possible collapse of the organization. A perfectionist, a technician of the game, and always a competitor, Dr. Rick has amassed a remarkable record of wins and finishes, including the 1988 Masters World Championship where his score bested the top Open finisher's. Rick Voakes' dedication to disc golf has made him its champion both on and off the course.</p>
