     <h1>Steve Slasor</h1>
     <em>1997 inductee</em><br/>
     <p>Although called "Slaze" by his closest friends, Steve Slasor has also answered to numerous nicknames — Mr. Consistency, Mr. Smooth, The Master, The Old Man — and all are a credit to his command of the flying disc. Slasor's strength is his ability to execute any kind of throw, and his trick shots are legendary for finding their mark. Always among the all-time leaders, Slasor continues to add to an impressive number of wins and high finishes, including the 1984 Masters World Championship and a Masters Doubles title in recent years. Competitive but humble, Steve Slasor quietly supports disc golf through contributions to the PDGA and by serving as a model sportsman.</p>
