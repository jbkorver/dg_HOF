     <h1>Chuck Kennedy</h1>
     <em>2006 inductee       </em>
     <p>Chuck is disc golf's mad scientist and creative genius. As the "Father of the PDGA
Ratings System", and the designer of more than 50 courses, few persons have
contributed more to the growth of disc golf and the PDGA than Chuck. At Pro
Worlds alone he has served as a host, scorekeeper, course designer, site
evaluator, schedule maker, bid writer, competitor, and spectator. A master
of the spreadsheet, Chuck has also authored many of the resources and
templates used by the PDGA to manage the National Tour and to promote the sport
today. His impact on the sport is beyond measure and will always be felt.</p>
