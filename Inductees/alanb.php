     <em>2002 inductee       </em>
     <p>Having a track record as one of the world's premier golfers is impossible to ignore. Since the early 80's, he has dedicated himself to all aspects of disc golf. His ability to balance his professional and family life with a busy touring schedule, while participating in promoting the sport on every level make him an outstanding role model. Alan's leadership in Charlotte has made possible the implementation of ten courses to date. He has been a mentor to several of the sportâ€™s top ranked professionals. His meticulous preparation and attention to detail as both a competitor and as a tournament director are legendary. Throughout his career he has represented our sport in a most exemplary manner. Without a doubt, Alan will continue to be a source of pride to Charlotte, to North Carolina, to our nation and to all disc golfers. </p>
