     <h1>Carlton Howard</h1>
     <em>1998 inductee       </em>
     <p>Carlton Howard discovered disc golf in 1977 and has since developed into one of the sport's most experienced and knowledgeable players. A master of the mechanics of putting and throwing, Carlton uses his talent to help others improve their game through insights gleaned from countless hours of practice. He has further advanced the ranks by helping to form and run the Raleigh Area Disc Golf League--a club which boasts one of the highest levels of amateur participation in the countryâ€”and by hosting dozens of national and regional disc golf events. In addition, Carlton Howard has ably served the PDGA as Competition Director and exhibited sterling leadership of the Rules Committee.</p>
