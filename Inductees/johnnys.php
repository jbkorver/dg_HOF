     <h1>Johnny Sias</h1>
     <em>2001 inductee</em><br/>
     <p>Johnny is one of the greatest putters to have ever played the game. He has won countless events on the PDGA tour and was one of the most dominant players in the game during the 1980s, capping off the decade with an exciting World's Championship title in 1986! His demeanor, conduct, and sportsmanship are an example to all that play. Johnny, with his wife, Adele, also volunteered to handle the membership function of the PDGA, without recognition or compensation. The PDGA may not have survived in the early years without their assistance. Together they set the standard, bringing integrity to the PDGA with their tireless work.</p>
