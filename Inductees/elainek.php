     <h1>Elaine King</h1>
     <em>1997 inductee       </em>
     <p>As the four-time Women's World Champion, Elaine King has dominated and been almost undefeatable on the pro tour. With a stunning number of victories to her credit and many more still to win, Elaine seemingly downplays her ability in an effort to not intimidate other players. Those who play with her find that she is gracious and a joy with whom to share a round of golf. Always exhibiting a professional demeanor, Elaine's powerful presence on the course evokes a sense of awe even among veteran players. In addition, Elaine King has distinguished herself as one of disc golf's most dedicated supporters by serving as PDGA Commissioner during a critical transition period and by continuing to work with the PDGA today.</p>
