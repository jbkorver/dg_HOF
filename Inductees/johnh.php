     <h1>John Houck</h1>
     <em>1998 inductee       </em>
     <p>As a disc golf promoter and entrepreneur, John Houck simply has no equal. He created the World's Biggest Disc Golf Weekend to annually introduce hundreds of new players to the game. Director of the popular Circular Skies Over Texas tour and National Doubles Championships, John has hosted dozens of top-ranked PDGA events including two World Championships. A prolific course designer, he helped Texas become the first state with 50 disc golf courses; and as PDGA Commissioner 1995-96, John brought stability and accountability to a fractured organization that needed help. Innovative, creative, patient and fair-minded, John Houck has made it his business to spread the joy of disc golf to the world.</p>
