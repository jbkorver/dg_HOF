     The disc golf Hall of Fame is an independent organization dedicated to the promotion of disc 
     golf,  its premier pioneers and players. Each year new Inductees are selected by the hall of 
     fame membership and the new inductees are introduced to the disc golf community at the PDGA 
     Awards Ceremony/DGHOF Induction  Ceremony. The celebration takes place at the site of the PDGA 
     World  Championships.
     <p>The institution was founded in 1993 by Lavone Wolfe of Huntsville Alabama. Lavone served at 
     the Chairman of the first Board of Directors. He also created the Hall of Fame Museum, a 
     collection of memorabilia that helps to describe the history of our sport.</p>
     <p>The museum used to travel to major tournaments, but has now found a home at the International 
     Disc Golf Center, north of Augusta, Georgia.</p>
